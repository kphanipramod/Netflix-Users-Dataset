## About Dataset:
The dataset offers a glimpse into a simulated sample of Netflix users, presenting a range of information about user subscriptions, earnings, account details, and engagement. Each entry corresponds to a distinct user, identified by a unique User ID. Within the dataset, users’ subscription tiers (Basic, Standard, or Premium), the revenue generated monthly from their subscriptions, their Netflix signup date (Join Date), the date of their most recent payment (Last Payment Date), and their country of residence are recorded. Supplementary columns have been incorporated to provide insights into user actions and inclinations. These additional attributes encompass Device Type (e.g., Smart TV, Mobile, Desktop, Tablet) and Account Status (indicating whether the account is currently active). It’s important to note that this dataset is a fabricated representation and does not mirror real Netflix user data. 

## Problem Statement:
To gain insights into hypothetical user patterns, preferences, and revenue streams within a simulated Netflix user pool.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
Jupyter Notebook, Seaborn, Pandas, Matplotlib.

## Data Collection:

## Data Cleaning:
Checked if any null values and deleted them.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
Visualized the cleaned data to see the trends. Created a histogram for the Polarity Score and created a Bar chart for Review data.

- Average Monthly Revenue by Subscription

- Number of Users in each Country

- Median age of Users in each Plan type

- Average age of Users by each device type

- Scatter Plot: Age vs Monthly Revenue by Gender

- Bar Plot: Average Monthly Revenue by Country

- Pair Plot: Monthly Revenue by Age

- Count Plot: Subscription Type Distribution
